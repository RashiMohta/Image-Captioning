# Image Captioning using Transfer Learning

This project aims to generate captions for images using a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained on the Flickr8k dataset, which contains images along with corresponding captions.
Instead of training a CNN from scratch to extract features from images, the pre-trained InceptionV3 model, which was trained on the ImageNet dataset, was used. By leveraging the knowledge gained during the pre-training on ImageNet, the InceptionV3 model already possesses the capability to extract high-level features from images effectively. These pre-trained features were then used as input to the captioning model, thereby leveraging the transfer learning approach to improve the performance of the image captioning system.

## Overview

The project consists of the following main components:

1. **Data Preparation**: 
    - Loading descriptions of images from the dataset.
    - Cleaning and preprocessing the text data.
    - Encoding images using InceptionV3 model to extract features.
    - Using pre-trained GloVe word embeddings.

2. **Model Architecture**:
    - Train an LSTM network to learn the sequential structure of captions given the image features extracted by the CNN.
    - Training the model to predict the next word in the caption sequence.

3. **Training**:
    - Training the model on the preprocessed dataset.
    - Fine-tuning the model by adjusting hyperparameters and optimizing the learning rate.
    - Saving model checkpoints at different epochs.

4. **Caption Generation**:
    - Implementing a greedy search algorithm to generate captions for new images.
    - Visualizing the generated captions alongside the corresponding images.
